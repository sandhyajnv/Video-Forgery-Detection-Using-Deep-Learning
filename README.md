**Introduction**

Video forgery detection is a critical task in ensuring the integrity and authenticity of multimedia content. In this project, we tackle the specific problem of detecting intraframe forgeries, where individual frames within a video sequence are manipulated. The proposed solution employs a combination of deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in identifying forged frames.

**Data Preparation**

Before training the model, you need to prepare your dataset. Ensure that you have a dataset containing both forged and unforged video frames. Each frame should be stored as an image, and it is advisable to stack a certain number of frames together to capture temporal information effectively.

**Model Architecture**

Our model architecture is designed to capture both spatial and temporal features in video frames. It consists of the following components:

**3D Convolutional Layer**

The first stage for temporal modeling utilizes 3D convolution kernels to capture inter-frame temporal motions by aggregating video frames. This component helps in mixing intra-frame and inter-frame features, which enhances performance.

**2D CNN**

A CNN with numerous 2D convolution kernels processes the output feature cube from the 3D convolutional layer. It generates 1D vectors for each video frame, effectively capturing intra-frame spatial information. Together with the 3D convolutional layer, this forms the CNN component of the model.

**Bi-directional LSTM Network**

To further model temporal information, we employ a multilayer bi-directional LSTM network. This network aggregates the output 1D vectors from the bottom 2D CNN layer over time. The fusion of high-level temporal features with LSTM significantly improves performance.

**Training**

To train the model, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset as described in the Data Preparation section.
Configure the model architecture and hyperparameters according to your specific dataset and requirements.
Split your dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
Train the model using appropriate training scripts, monitoring the loss and accuracy on the validation set.
Fine-tune the model as needed based on validation results.
**Usage**

Once you have trained your model, you can use it for video forgery detection. Provide video frames as input to the trained model, and it will predict whether each frame is forged or unforged. You can integrate this model into your application or use it for forensic analysis.
